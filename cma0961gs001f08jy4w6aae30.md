By Wahab Abayomi Omiwole

Across the world's diverse traditions — religious, philosophical, academic, indigenous, and secular — human beings have searched for light in their darkest hours. In this two-part series, we explore the deep reservoirs of wisdom that remind us: healing is possible, and hope never truly leaves. Whether you lean toward the spiritual, the philosophical, or simply the human, there's something here for you.

In times of emotional low points — when the burdens of life seem too much to bear — humanity has always turned to sources of wisdom to find hope and renewal. This series explores voices from across traditions — religious, philosophical, indigenous, and secular — with the heart that every soul, whatever their belief, can find light for the journey.

Part 1 draws from sacred scriptures across various traditions, offering glimpses of grace, mercy, and resilience when we need them most — all pointing to one universal truth: Love is a constant, always present to comfort and support humanity in its darkest moments.

**Reflection:**

The Fall is anchored on God’s plan of salvation and happiness for His children. According to President Russell M. Nelson, “When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening-or not happening-in our lives. Joy comes from Him and because of Him. He is the source of all joy.”

## 🌌 **Srimad Bhagavatam — Canto 10, Chapter 14, Verse 8 (Hinduism)**

## 🌌 Ifa: The Sacred Wisdom of the Yoruba People

> *"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice."*

## Closing Reflection for Part 1

From East to West, North to South, sacred writings call out with one voice: **You are not forgotten. Your pain is not the end of your story.**

Hidden in the soil of suffering is the seed of something luminous — a rebirth you may not yet see, but that is quietly unfolding even now.

> ✨ If these ancient words stirred something in you, we’d love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to **share**, **comment**, and **pass this along** to someone who might need a little extra light today. Stay tuned for Part 2, where we’ll journey into timeless philosophies and indigenous traditions that remind us: **Healing, wholeness, and hope are the shared inheritance of the human heart.**
