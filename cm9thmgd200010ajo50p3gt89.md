*By Wahab Abayomi Omiwole*

Life doesn’t always unfold the way we plan.

There are seasons when things bloom — when clarity, purpose, and peace align. Then there are seasons of waiting, where nothing feels certain. I've found myself in both.

Recently, I entered a quiet, in-between space. Without a job, unsure of the next step, I could’ve spiraled into anxiety. But something kept me steady: **grace**—and a daily commitment to live well, from the inside out.

## Faith: My Anchor in the Unseen

Faith isn’t just about believing that things will get better. It’s trusting — even when nothing around you seems to be changing. One scripture that has stayed with me is:

> “Be still, and know that I am God.” – Psalm 46:10

Stillness isn’t easy in a world that constantly urges us to hustle. But I’ve learned that in the silence, **grace speaks**. Faith reminds me that my worth isn’t tied to productivity or titles. It’s rooted in something far deeper.

## Wellness: A Daily Act of Grace

During this season, I turned to simple wellness practices — not as a way to escape my reality, but to honor it:

* Meditation to center my thoughts and calm my mind.
    
* Mindful breathing and quiet reflection.
    
* Herbal teas in the morning.
    
* Gratitude journaling.
    
* Spending time in nature, letting the breeze remind me that I’m alive — and that’s enough for today.
    

Wellness isn’t a trend for me. It’s a **spiritual act** — an invitation to care for the body and mind God gave me.

## Growth in the Waiting

Waiting seasons have a purpose. They refine us. They teach us to let go of control and lean into trust.

**What if this waiting is not a pause, but a preparation?**

In this season, I’m learning that growth isn’t always about doing more. Sometimes, it’s simply about becoming more rooted in who you are — and *Whose* you are.

## Rooted in Grace

If you’re in a time of uncertainty, I want you to know:  
You’re not alone.  
You’re not behind.  
You’re not forgotten.

Let faith be your foundation.  
Let simple wellness rituals restore your rhythm.  
And let grace carry you when your strength runs low.

Because even now, you’re growing.

**Rooted. Watered. Becoming.**
